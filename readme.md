#React JS [Quickstart]
This is super quick ,lets get stuff started pack for React JS


## NPM Me!
Here's a list of stuff you're going to need. If you don't want to spend time installing each one of them, just download the `package.json` and do `npm install` and that'll take care of everything.

OR if you have your own package.json, just include this ::

```
"dependencies": {
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.22.0",
    "jquery": "^3.1.1",
    "react": "^15.4.2",
    "react-dom": "^15.4.2",
    "react-router": "^2.0.1",
    "webpack": "^2.2.0-rc.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.22.1",
    "babel-loader": "^6.2.10",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6.22.0",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^2.26.0",
    "webpack": "^2.2.0-rc.1",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^1.16.2"
  }
```
